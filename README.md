# It is going to be talking about mostly gradient descent in mathematical terms on ANNs

### This repository is dedicated to exploring one central question: ###
👉 Why do over-parameterized neural networks exhibit linear convergence under gradient descent?



## Rather than presenting a full formal proof or dense theoretical exposition, the goal here is to create a space where we can:

### Discuss ideas ###
From high-level intuition to subtle technical details—anything that helps understand why training behaves so nicely in the over-parameterized regime.

### Share code ###
Minimal reproductions, experiments, or visualizations that help demonstrate the dynamics behind convergence.

### Ask questions and refine understanding together ###
Whether you're deeply familiar with the theory or just starting to explore it, this is a place to think out loud.

### Build intuition, not just list equations ###
The focus is on conversations, insights, geometry, and empirical behavior rather than formal math.

### 🎯 What this repository is for ### 

1. A small community-style sandbox to reason about the behavior of wide neural nets
2. A place to drop small experiments that reveal interesting phenomena
3. A space where advanced concepts can be broken down and discussed casually
4. A living document of ideas, conversations, and incremental clarifications

### 💬 How to use this repo ###

1. Open or join issues to discuss whatever aspect interests you
2. Submit minimal code snippets or experiments via pull requests
3. Ask conceptual questions, share intuition, or propose new angles
4. Help others understand or be corrected by others—this is the point

### 🤝 Contribution philosophy ###

You don’t need a fully polished idea to contribute here.
Even a small insight, a confusion, or a thought experiment is welcome.

If your contribution helps one more person gain intuition about the dynamics of over-parameterized networks, it already has value.

### 🚀 Final note ###

This repository is meant to be an open conversation, not just a static explanation.
As discussions grow and experiments accumulate, we hope to build a clearer picture—together—of why linear convergence emerges in such surprisingly simple ways.
